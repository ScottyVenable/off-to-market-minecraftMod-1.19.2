VERSION 0.4.8
---
- The Send to market button is still stuck on gray. Lets just make it automatically enabled, removing the greying out.
- Breaking the Trading ledger bin dropped all the items it had, even though they were stored in a connected container.
- Rename the ledger item to "Master Ledger" which shows all the items from all Trading Ledger bins and allows the user to click "Send to Market" from there.
- Move the listing view (56 listings 1-14, etc) down below the listing window.
- Remove the ability to manually refresh the Market Board and instead show a timer of how long until it refreshes automatically.
- Make the cart button have the same style as the tabbed buttons in the trading post menu. The trading post menu tabs and design should be universal.
- Shrink down the height of the area in the Bin where it says "Select an item to view modifiers" and increase the Modifiers section height.
- Have the trading bin renamed to Trading Ledger in the UI.
- Have the trading ledger block tabs be the same style as the tabs from the Trading Post UI.

VERSION 0.4.9
- Allow the option to search in the Market Board with a search bar, by removing one entry worth of space, and putting the search bar above. Maybe even a dropdown next to it for the type of item to look for? Searching a town shows only that towns items.
- Allow more quantity for items that markets may have a lot of, especially if the player is higher level they may provide more item quantity in the market.
- Putting an item in your cart should remove it from the listing, removing it from your cart should put it back on the listing. Only taking partial amounts just removes the amount from the quantity listed.
- Add a tiny bit more space between Activity items in the Trading Post and therefore increase the background cells to be a bit more height as well to accomadate them.
- Items not sold in the previous day should have a max listing of 3 days. On the last day when hovering it should say "Final day on the market" in red. A shop might decide to put it on sale too if it's the last day. On the fourth day, they are removed from the market and replaced with other items. Additionally, at any point, a shop might "decide" to remove an item and replace it regardless or add more items alongside their other listings.
